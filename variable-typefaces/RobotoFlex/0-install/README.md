In order to user the multipolation designspace file you need to install this little script.

### Install

1. Move this file to the script folder of Glyphs.
2. Now it is executable in Glyphs via Script > Metapolation :)

### Feautres
- Infinte numbers of Axes
- Infinite numbers of Masters on one Axis
- An axis can be added by adding only one Master (not two extremes)
- Custom value-scales + simple math (e.g. "none+20", "half", "full", "min", "max-100", ...)
- Master-Relations, allowing multiple “Roots" (e.g. Root > Bold > Bold Inktraps)
- x- and y-interpolation
- Local interpolations (allowing different interpolation values for specified glyphs)
- ...
